# Each line represents a (min, max) tuple
# you can input expression and numpy functions (e.g. np.pi)
# without options it consider by default a uniform distribution with min and max value
# options:
# - nan     : set it to default values or estimate the most likely for v_init,zenith_angle,m_init,erosion_height_start (default norm sigma only for v_init 500 and zenith_angle 0.01)
# - norm    : considers instead of uniform distribution a normal distribution and substitutes min and max with mean and sigma, good for velocity or zenith angle
# - invgamma: considers instead of uniform distribution a inverse gamma distribution that peak around the mode and have a long trail so it substitutes min and max with alpha and mode, good for noise uncertanty
# - log     : cosider the log10 of the range given consider it for priors that extend for multiple order of magnitude (if 0.0 is set to 1e-12)
# - fix     : fix the value to the first value given so it is not estimated by dynesty, the assumend noise in lag (noise_lag) for EMCCD is 40 m and CAMO is 5 m while for both in luminosity (noise_lum) is 2.5 J/s
# what is writen after '#' is ignored
# name var, min/sigma/alpha, max/mean/mode, options
