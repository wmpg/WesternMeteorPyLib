# Solving a trajectory

**The trajectory solver** turns multi-station meteor observations into a trajectory and a heliocentric
orbit, and saves the result as a pickle file. That pickle is the input to most of the rest of the
library, including [the REBOUND integrator](REBOUND.md), so this page is mainly about how to produce
one and what is inside it.

## Running the solver

The solver is driven through the input format of your data, not through a single generic entry point.
Each format module under `wmpl/Formats/` has its own command line interface that reads the
observations, runs the solver and writes the results:

```
python -m wmpl.Formats.ECSV /path/to/event/*.ecsv
python -m wmpl.Formats.RMSJSON /path/to/event/*.json
python -m wmpl.Formats.CAMS /path/to/event/
python -m wmpl.Formats.Met /path/to/event.met
```

Run any of them with `--help` for the full list of options. The ones that matter most often:

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-s`, `--solver` | Which solver to use. `original` (default) is the Monte Carlo solver; `gural0`–`gural3` are the Gural multi-parameter fits with constant, linear, quadratic and exponential deceleration. |
| `-r`, `--mcruns` | Number of Monte Carlo runs used to estimate the uncertainties. |
| `-d`, `--disablemc` | Only compute the geometric solution, skipping the Monte Carlo step. Fast, but gives no uncertainties. |
| `-t`, `--maxtoffset` | Maximum timing offset allowed between stations, in seconds. |
| `-v`, `--vinitht` | Estimate the initial velocity as the average above this height, in km. |
| `-l`, `--plotallspatial` | Save the full set of diagnostic plots. |

To see the solver working on a synthetic example without any data of your own:

```
python -m wmpl.Trajectory.Trajectory
```

### Additional fragments in ECSV files

ECSV files can describe more fragments than the main one, as in Appendix 4 of the GFE standard: one row
per frame, with the columns of each additional fragment carrying its number as a suffix (`datetime1`,
`ra1`, `dec1`, `azimuth1`, `altitude1`, ...), empty on the frames where it was not measured. The main
fragment, fragment 0, is always solved from the columns without a suffix (or with the optional suffix 0),
leaving out its points with `trajectory_use` = False (e.g. saturated flares kept in the file).

```
python -m wmpl.Formats.ECSV /path/to/event/*.ecsv --fragments
```

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--fragments` | After the main fragment, solve every additional fragment seen from at least 2 stations with the same options (Monte Carlo included), save each one in a `fragment_k` folder of the output directory, and print how it differs from the main one: radiant, velocities, heights, distance from the main path and how far ahead of the main fragment it is at the same time. |
| `--fragtimefit` | Estimate the station time offsets for every fragment, instead of reusing those of the main trajectory, which its larger number of points constrains better. |

Two solutions differ slightly even for identical data, as each goes through its own iterations of the
timing and velocity estimation: in tests, by about 0.001 deg and tens of metres with well spread stations,
and up to about 0.1 deg and a few hundred metres with nearly parallel ones. With the Monte Carlo runs, the
solutions compared are still those with the original picks (not the best Monte Carlo runs, which differ by
about 1 sigma even for identical data), and the differences are also given in units of the combined
uncertainty. The time offsets reused by the fragments are also those of the main solution with the original
picks, the ones in its report.

If the solver fits the initial velocity with a drag and ablation model, it does so for every fragment from its
own first point, so the velocity of a fragment is the one at its first point, and a height limit of the fit
leaves out the fragments that appear below it, which keep the straight line. The comparison says which method
every solution used.

## The trajectory pickle

A successful run writes `<event>_trajectory.pickle` (plus plots and a text report) into the output
directory. The pickled object is a `wmpl.Trajectory.Trajectory.Trajectory`. The attributes used by the
other tools are:

| Attribute | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `traj.jdt_ref` | Reference epoch of the trajectory, as a Julian date in TDB. |
| `traj.traj_id` | Identifier of the event, e.g. `20191023_091225`. Used as the object name downstream. |
| `traj.orbit` | The computed heliocentric orbit, including the geocentric radiant and velocity. |
| `traj.state_vect_mini`, `traj.v_init`, `traj.radiant_eci_mini` | Position, speed and radiant direction at the reference point. Together these are the state vector REBOUND starts from. |
| `traj.uncertainties` | One-sigma uncertainties from the Monte Carlo runs, used to draw clones. |
| `traj.observations` | The per-station observations that went into the fit. |

## Loading a pickle in Python

```python
import os
from wmpl.Utils.Pickling import loadPickle

pickle_path = "/path/to/20191023_091225_trajectory.pickle"
traj = loadPickle(*os.path.split(pickle_path))

print(traj.traj_id, traj.jdt_ref)
print("a = {:.4f} AU, e = {:.4f}".format(traj.orbit.a, traj.orbit.e))
```

Once you have the pickle, see [the REBOUND manual](REBOUND.md) for integrating the orbit backwards or
forwards in time.
